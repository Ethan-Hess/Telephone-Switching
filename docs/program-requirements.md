# Telephone Switching Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates basic telephone functions. You will not be hooked up to real phones, but instead will input commands from the keyboard and display results. Your system will make phone calls, as well as perform three-way conferences and transfers.

---

## Requirements

### 1. Data Loading

At startup, the program will read a file containing phone numbers and names. There may be **up to 20 such pairs**, one per line.

### 2. Phone Number Format

The phone numbers are **5 digits long**, all numbers. A phone number **may begin with 0**.

### 3. Phone Name Format

The names are a single name field **up to 12 characters**. Names are a single word (no first name, last name; let's keep it simple). Names are all alphabetic: **A-Za-z**.

### 4. Commands

The following commands are supported:

```
phone call phone
phone offhook
phone onhook
phone transfer phone
phone conference phone
```

### 5. Phone Identifiers

In each command, the `phone` is either the **phone number** or the **name**.

### 6. Possible Responses

The system may produce the following responses. See later requirements for the conditions for each response:

- `phone hears dialtone`
- `phone hears ringback`
- `phone hears ringing`
- `phone hears busy`
- `phone hears denial`
- `phone hears silence`
- `phone and phone are talking`
- `phone and phone and phone are talking`

## Call Flow Scenarios

### 7. Normal Call Flow

1. `phone1 offhook` (command from user)
2. `phone1 hears dialtone` (response from computer)
3. `phone1 call phone2` (command from user)
4. `phone1 hears ringback` (response from computer)
5. `phone2 hears ringing` (response from computer)
6. `phone2 offhook` (command from user)
7. `phone1 and phone2 are talking` (response from computer)
8. `phone2 onhook` (command from user)
9. `phone1 hears silence` (response from computer)

### 8. Conference Call

**Precondition:** `phone1` and `phone2` are talking

1. `phone1` (or `phone2`) `conference phone3`
2. `phone1 hears ringback`
3. `phone3 hears ringing`
4. `phone3 offhook`
5. `phone1 and phone2 and phone3 are talking`
6. `phone1 onhook`
7. `phone2 and phone3 are talking`
8. `phone1 hears silence`

### 9. Transfer Call

**Precondition:** `phone1` and `phone2` are talking

1. `phone1 transfer phone3`
2. `phone1 hears ringback`
3. `phone3 hears ringing`
4. `phone3 offhook`
5. `phone1 hears silence`
6. `phone2 and phone3 are talking`

### 10. Busy Signal

**Scenario:** `phone1` and `phone2` are talking on a phone call

1. `phone3 offhook`
2. `phone3 hears dialtone`
3. `phone3 call phone1`
4. `phone3 hears busy`

## Error Handling

### 11. Denial Tone - Invalid Operations (Offhook)

**Example scenario:**

1. `phone1 offhook`
2. `phone1 hears dialtone`
3. `phone1 call illegal_phone`
4. `phone1 hears denial`

**General rule:** If the phone is **offhook**, and tries to do something illegal (dial an invalid phone number, or tries to do more than a 3-way conference), the phone **hears denial**. See one exception below.

### 12. Silence - Commands While Onhook

**Example scenario:**

1. `phone1 call phone2` (without going offhook)
2. `phone1 hears silence`

**General rule:** If the phone is **onhook**, and tries to do anything except going offhook, the phone **hears silence**.

### 13. Ignored - Duplicate Offhook

**Example scenario:**

1. `phone1 offhook`
2. `phone1 hears dialtone`
3. `phone1 offhook`
4. (nothing happens)

**General rule:** If the phone is **offhook**, and tries to go offhook again, the action is **ignored**. You decide whether to print a message or not.

## Status Command

### 14. Status Display

Command: `status`

**Function:** Displays the status of the system. Lists each phone's status, and if it is on a call, who it is talking to (could be more than one other phone).
